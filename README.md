# SC2_BOT
something like future bot
Overall idea was to make makro bot, which implements other bots(through managers), deducing on revealed enemy units/units_power : approximate_time
Because of lack of resources for now(PC) and very low uptime 'cause of war in Ukraine, I only had few hours a day for learning... 
and almost no time for coding bot.
So I released only expansions and workers makro atm.
